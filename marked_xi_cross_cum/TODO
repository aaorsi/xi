In order of relevance:

	* Check the periodic boundary conditions

	* Check the final result when using many fragments, 
	  apparently gives an overestimation. The problem might be
	  on readxi.pro instead of the code itself

	* Test xi when using DensityFieldFlag = 'false'
	  - Implement the splitting of the random catalogue and 
		several independent RR counts

	* Implement the calculation of Xi(sigma, pi)

	* Implement a simple parallelisation for usage in Cosma
